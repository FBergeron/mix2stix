# Mix2Stix

Mix2Stix fills your mp3 player with random files.

## What is Mix2Stix?

Mix2Stix is a tool which fills MP3 sticks with files of 
specified types randomly. Therefor, it takes files with the 
given cumulative size from the source directories and copies 
them into the specified destination directory.
To make it simple: You can tale potluck every day of which 
music your stick contains. (Of course, you can use Mix2Stix 
to random-copy any files to any drive, e.g. memory cards, 
floppies or hard disks.)

Since Mix2Stix was written in Java, it's usable on any 
platform. Thanks to my brother Arild, who had the idea for 
this program (and who always was a tough tester).

## Installation

The most important requirement to run Mix2Stix is a current 
Java runtime environment. In its latest version you can find 
and download it at www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp.

Mix2Stix itself doesn't require an installation. The program 
starts by executing "Mix2Stix.jar" in the program's 
directory.

Should your local compressing tool (e.g. WinZip) be executed 
after starting Mix2Stix.jar, please unlink the file type 
"JAR" in its settings.

process is active, the status window.
